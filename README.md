# Drought Risk Assessment in Rwanda
Problem Definition
Drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages that can 
severely impact agriculture, food security, and livelihoods. In Rwanda, where agriculture is the 
backbone of the economy and employs a significant portion of the population, drought poses a 
critical threat. The country is highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture, making it vulnerable to 
climate variability. Drought can lead to crop failures, livestock losses, and increased food prices, 
exacerbating poverty and malnutrition.
In the broader African context, drought is a recurring challenge that affects millions, leading to 
humanitarian crises, displacement, and conflict over scarce resources. As climate change 
intensifies, the frequency and severity of droughts are expected to increase, making effective 
drought risk assessment and management essential for sustainable development.
Relevance in the Rwandan/African Context
 Food Security: Rwanda's economy relies heavily on agriculture, which is sensitive to 
rainfall patterns. Drought can lead to food shortages and increased malnutrition rates.
 Economic Impact: Agriculture contributes significantly to Rwanda's GDP. Drought can 
disrupt economic stability and growth.
 Social Stability: Drought can lead to migration, conflict over resources, and social 
unrest, particularly in rural areas.
 Climate Change: With climate change, the patterns of rainfall are becoming more 
unpredictable, increasing the need for robust drought risk assessment frameworks.
Key Stakeholders
 Government Agencies: Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources, Rwanda 
Meteorology Agency, Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs.
 Local Communities: Farmers, pastoralists, and local leaders.
 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): Organizations focused on food security, 
climate adaptation, and humanitarian aid.
 International Organizations: UN agencies, World Bank, and other development 
partners.
 Research Institutions: Universities and research organizations focusing on climate 
science and agriculture.
IF-THEN Rules
 IF rainfall is below 50% of the average for two consecutive months THEN issue a drought 
alert to local communities.
 IF drought conditions persist for three months THEN initiate water conservation 
measures and provide technical support to farmers.
 IF crop yield is reduced by more than 30% due to drought THEN implement emergency 
food aid and support programs.
 IF livestock mortality exceeds 10% THEN provide veterinary services and feed support to 
affected communities.
 IF drought conditions are classified as severe (based on a defined index) THEN mobilize 
national and international resources for disaster response![flow_chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99826ddc-35e5-4c80-b506-598cfa1adb98)
